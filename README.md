# Milestone Project: Pixie Games

This project focuses on the website development for an e-commerce store that sells games and allows users to leave reviews. The website is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. It is targeted towards users interested in purchasing games and being involved in the community. 

# User Authentication and Restriction

Unregistered users are able to view the game catalog, search for games and read reviews.

Logged in users are able to search for games, add games to cart and leave reviews, whereas superusers are able to create, delete, edit games and delete reviews. 

Please register as a new user to add games to cart and add reviews. 

- To log in as user without CRUD rights:
```
Username: karen
Password: karen123456
```


- To log in as a superuser with CRUD rights:
```
Username: soycat
Password: dead123

## Project Structure
### (i) Overview
- Homepage - The homepage has a slideshow that showcases games sold on the website. Below that, there is a short description of the website and how the users can interact with it. There is also a collapsible navigation bar (hamburger menu) on the right-hand side of the website. 

- Game Catalog Page - The games catalog page showcases all the games sold on the website.

- Cart - Games can be reviewed by the user before the user is ready to complete their purchase. 

- Community Reviews - This page allows logged in users to leave reviews and unregistered users to read reviews posted.

### (ii) Wireframes here.

## Project Skeleton
### (i) Existing Features
- Homepage - The slideshow gives users a peek into the games sold at the site. Additionally, the short introduction of the website gives users a little more detail about how to go about using the site.  There is a collapsible  navigation bar on the top-right hand corner of the homepage. This was placed to give users easier access to navigate the different pages easily and quickly. Upon clicking the icon, the icon will open a full screen overlay for users to see the different pages in the website. 

- Games Catalog - Bootstrap features such as cards were used to display information about each of the games sold on the site. Some of the information includes title, price, category, publisher, release date, etc. This will give users more information about the game before they add the game(s) to cart. User authentication  only allows logged in users to add games to cart, after which they will see a message pop-up that indicates that the game has been successfully added to the cart. Additionally, only the admin or superuser is able to create, edit, delete games. 

- Cart/View Cart - Only logged in users will be able to add games to their cart and view their cart before completing their purchase. Clicking on the view cart button will allow logged in users to view their cart and allow them to add or reduce their cart for each item. When reducing or adding more copies of the game on the view cart page, the users will be able to see the subtotal as soon as they add or reduce their items. 

- Checkout - Logged in users will then be able to checkout their items as soon as they are satisfied with their selections. Once they click on checkout, they will be redirected to stripe payment to complete their purchase. Once the payment is successful, a message will popup to show that the payment was successful and a unique steam ID has been sent to their email. 

- Community Reviews - Only admin/superuser will be able to delete reviews. Unregistered users can see user reviews but will not be able to leave reviews. 

### (ii) Features to implement in the future
In the future, I would like to create a function for the unique steam ID to be sent to the users email address once they have successfully completed payment. 

I would also like to include an option to edit and update reviews. 

Another feature to implement in the future includes allowing registered and logged in users who have created their reviews to only edit and update their reviews - they will not be able to edit other users' reviews. 

There should also be a contact form or form of contact that allows users to reach out via social media or directly to the admin. 

Finally, I would like to include a profile page that allows users to access their profile, upload pictures, see their username and password. Registered users will also be able to edit, update and delete their profile. 

###Limitation 
After checkout, users are only prompted with a message that they have completed their purchase successfully. No email confirmation is sent to their email address.

## Project Surface
### Design Choices
(i) The color scheme of bright blue and black creates contrast to make it more eye-catching and outstanding to users. I also believe that the colour scheme appeals to users.

(ii) The font was chosen to reflect a more "techy" feel of the website.

(iii) Background image is black so that it doesn't distract users from the games displayed on the website.

## Bugs Discovered
No bugs found. 

## Deployment
My code was written using AWS. AWS serves as the local repository before it is deployed to GitHub. New commits made on the master branch will update the deployed site in real time. I add new changes and commit them in bash in AWS, before git pushing it to my GitHub. After all the changes have been made, and I'm done making minor changes to my project, I type git push heroku master into the bash so that my code is deployed in Heroku.

To access my project in GitHub, I will find it under Repositories to check if all my commits are up-to-date. To access my project under Heroku, I will select django-angie (the app name I provided for Heroku) and view my project. When I click django-project-4, it will redirect me to another page that records all my activity. On the top hand side, there is an open app button that will let me access my website.

### Media
